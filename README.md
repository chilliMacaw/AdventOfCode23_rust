# AdventOfCode23_rust

This is my journy to learn Rust, before this i have only written hello world to check if everything is working.
So if you come across this, i hope you can see improvements from day to day, or just have fun reading it.
***But this should not be used, if you are looking for the fastest or best ways to solve AoC23 in Rust.***
